The ISYMBot is a simple Markov text generator that generates posts in the style of I Saw You MIT (http://isawyou.mit.edu). The Markov text generator uses a 3-gram model by default but can use any chain length you want. An HTML scraper is included that allows you to build a text file of ISYM posts from the website. A corpus of ISYM posts is included in isymbot_text.txt.
